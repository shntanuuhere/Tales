# Android Build Fix for Tales App

This document explains how to fix the Android build issues in the Tales app.

## Issue

The app fails to build with the following error:

```
A problem occurred configuring project ':image_gallery_saver'.
> Could not create an instance of type com.android.build.api.variant.impl.LibraryVariantBuilderImpl.
   > Namespace not specified. Specify a namespace in the module's build file.
```

This is because the `image_gallery_saver` plugin (version 1.7.1) doesn't have a namespace specified in its build.gradle file, which is required for newer versions of the Android Gradle Plugin.

## Solution 1: Dependency Override (Recommended)

We've added a dependency override in the `pubspec.yaml` file to use a newer version of the `image_gallery_saver` plugin that has the namespace issue fixed:

```yaml
dependency_overrides:
  image_gallery_saver: ^2.0.3
```

To apply this fix:

1. Run `flutter clean`
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Try building again: `flutter build apk --debug`

## Solution 2: Manual Fix

If the dependency override doesn't work, you can manually fix the plugin:

1. Run the `fix_image_gallery_saver.bat` script in the project root
2. Run `flutter clean`
3. Run `flutter pub get`
4. Try building again: `flutter build apk --debug`

## Solution 3: Comprehensive Fix

For a more comprehensive fix that addresses multiple plugins:

1. Run the `fix_all_plugins.bat` script in the project root
2. Run `flutter clean`
3. Run `flutter pub get`
4. Try building again: `flutter build apk --debug`

## Additional Notes

- The issue is related to the Android Gradle Plugin 8.0+ requiring explicit namespace declarations
- This is a common issue when using older Flutter plugins with newer Android Gradle Plugin versions
- The fix adds the missing namespace to the plugin's build.gradle file
